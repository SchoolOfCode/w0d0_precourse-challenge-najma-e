      <p> Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace; widely known as Ada Lovelace, was born Augusta Ada Byron on the 10th of December 1815, and was the daughter of the famous romantic poet Lord Byron, and his only legitimate child. She was also the only child to come out of the brief and unhappy marriage between Lord Byron, and her mother, Annabella Milbanke. </p>
      <p> Her mother was the polar opposite of her husband, with a passion for mathematics, a passion which also became deeply rooted in Lovelace. Her mother raised her under a strict regiment of science, logic, and maths, in a bid to avoid Lovelace taking after her father, who championed romantic ideals and was often moody and of an erratic temperament. The route of her education was unusual for a woman in 19th century England, as a woman’s education usually revolved around being an accomplished young lady with skills such as singing, sewing, playing the piano, good etiquette, and dancing, to name a few, in order to secure a suitable husband. </p>
      <p> Since she was a child, Lovelace was fascinated with machines. Her childhood was often spent looking at and analysing the diagrams of the machines created during the Industrial Revolution which filled the scientific journals at the time, as well as designing boats and steam-flying machines, which were elaborate and fanciful. </p>
      <p> At the age of 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, an inventor, and mathematician who became known as the “father of the computer” after he created the difference engine, a mechanical calculator, and she subsequently became his protégé. Lovelace was inspired by her mentor’s inventions, but unlike Babbage, who believed his machines' functions were limited to numerical calculations, Lovelace predicted that computers “might act upon other things besides numbers”. </p>
      <p> Babbage further created plans for another machine called the analytic engine, which was designed to handle more complex calculations. In 1843, Lovelace was asked to translate an article written by the Italian engineer and mathematician Luigi Federico Menabrea on Babbage’s analytical machine, titled “Notions sur la machine analytique de Charles Babbage” (1842; “Elements of Charles Babbage’s Analytical Machine”). </p>
      <p> Not only did she translate the original text from French to English, Lovelace additionally added extensive annotations to the article, with her notes being three times longer than the original article written by Menabrea. In her notes, Lovelace described and offered many forward-thinking ideas and theories, such as how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols along with numbers, as well as theorising a method for the analytical engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer programs use today. </p>
      <p> Her revolutionary notes have led to Lovelace being cited as the world’s first computer programmer, although her article received little attention during her lifetime. It is only recently that her contributions and legacy have been celebrated. In 2009, the second Tuesday in October has become Ada Lovelace Day, on which the contributions of women in STEM are honoured. </p>
