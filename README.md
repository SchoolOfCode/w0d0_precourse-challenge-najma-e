## A Tribute Page for Ada Lovelace.

As we embark on a coding Bootcamp, it is only fitting that I pay homage to none other than Ada Lovelace – the world’s first computer programmer. In recent times, software engineering has been seen as largely male-orientated. What might surprise you, however, is that just a few decades ago, women dominated the field.  At a time where attitudes revolved around women ruling the domestic sphere and churning out babies, many women were doing extraordinary things.

Indeed, the film Hidden Figures have shed light on the true story of three black women who worked for NASA as programmers, mathematicians, and engineers in the 1960s – Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson – who were vital in preparing astronaut John Glenn's orbital, and helped successfully launch him into space. Despite the racial and sexist challenges they faced both in their personal and professional lives, they persevered and did incredible things. Though, as the film showed, it is only just recently that these women have become more widely known for their contributions.

This isn’t *only* true for these women, however, but for countless more women, who made great strides in the development of computer science and programming but are not known today for their contributions. This is why I’ve decided to make a tribute page for Ada Lovelace, as I wanted to be a part of showcasing the achievements of this incredible woman, and all she did for the field of computer science.
